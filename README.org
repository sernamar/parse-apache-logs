* parse-apache-logs
An application to parse logs generated by Apache (a HTTP server).

* Data
We'll use the public [[https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/edgar-log-file-data-set.html][EDGAR Log File Data Set]], published by the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission).
  
The EDGAR Log File Data Set contains information in CSV format extracted from Apache log files that record and store user access statistics for the SEC.gov website.

* Database configuration
Create a file named ~config.edn~ containing a map with the key ~:db-params~ whose value is a map containing the Postgres configuration parameters:
#+begin_src clojure
  {:db-params {:dbtype "postgres"
	       :dbname "dbname"
	       :port "port"
	       :username "username"
	       :password "password"
	       :dataSourceProperties {:socketTimeout 30}}}
#+end_src
